# Data_Analysis_using_Python-SQL
Description 📝
This project loads e-commerce data from CSV files into a MySQL database and analyzes it with SQL queries and Python. It finds insights like customer locations, sales by category, and top spenders, with a cool bar plot visualization! 🚀
Tools Used 🛠️

🐍 Python 3.x: For data processing and visualization.
📚 Pandas: To handle CSV files and dataframes.
🗄️ MySQL Connector: To connect and load data into MySQL.
📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating the bar plot.
🗃️ MySQL: Database to store and query data.
📓 Jupyter Notebook: To run and display the code.

Challenges Faced 😓

🕵️‍♂️ NaN Values: Handling missing data in CSVs was tricky, but replaced with None for SQL.
🔗 Database Connection: Setting up MySQL credentials and ensuring connectivity took some trial and error.
📉 Visualization: Adjusting the bar plot to show top customers clearly required tweaking rotations and labels.
⏱️ Query Performance: Writing efficient SQL queries for large datasets was a bit challenging.
